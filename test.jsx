Question II:

Consider a file system simlar to UNIX where the data blaock size is 4kb (4096 bytes) and each pointer
(that contains a black number) is defined on 4 Bytes. Suppose that the file I-node contains 12 direct
pointers, 1 simple indirect pointer, 1 double indirect pointer and 1 triple indirect pointer. We want
to create a file containing 20.000.000 (twenty millions) characters (each character is on one byte).
What is the total internal fragmentation (The unused spaces in the blocks) on the disk resulting from 
the creation of this file?
